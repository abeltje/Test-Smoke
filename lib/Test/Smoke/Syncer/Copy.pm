=head1 Test::Smoke::Syncer::Copy

This handles syncing with the B<File::Copy> module from a local
directory. It uses the B<MANIFEST> file is the source directory
to determine which fiels to copy. The current source-tree removed
before the actual copying.

=cut

=head2 Test::Smoke::Syncer::Copy->new( %args )

This crates the new object. Keys for C<%args>:

  * ddir:    destination directory ( ./perl-current )
  * cdir:    directory to copy from ( undef )
  * v:       verbose

=cut

=head2 $syncer->sync( )

This uses B<Test::Smoke::SourceTree> to do the actual copying.  After
that it will clean up the source-tree (from F<MANIFEST>, but ignoring
F<MANIFEST.SKIP>!).

=cut

sub sync {
    my $self = shift;

    $self->{cdir} eq $self->{ddir} and do {
        require Carp;
        Carp::croak( "Sourcetree cannot be copied onto it self!" );
    };

    $self->pre_sync;
    require Test::Smoke::SourceTree;

    my $tree = Test::Smoke::SourceTree->new($self->{cdir}, $self->verbose);
    $tree->copy_from_MANIFEST($self->{ddir});

    $tree = Test::Smoke::SourceTree->new( $self->{ddir} );
    $tree->clean_from_MANIFEST( 'MANIFEST.SKIP' );

    my $plevel = $self->check_dot_patch;
    $self->post_sync;
    return $plevel;
